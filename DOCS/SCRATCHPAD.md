## Session History

### 2026-01-12 (Initial Build)
Started from JaysJoints React project, converted to pure HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity and easy GitHub Pages deployment without Actions.

Key decisions:
- Pure HTML over React = no build step
- Glassmorphism design with teal/cyan accent
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- localStorage for preferences
